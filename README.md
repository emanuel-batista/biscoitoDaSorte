# Fortune Cookie

This is a simple "Fortune Cookie" app built with **React Native**. When the user clicks the button, a random motivational message is displayed.

## Technologies Used

- **React Native**: To create the app's interface.
- **Class Components**: Used to structure the application.
- **State (setState)**: To store the fortune message and cookie image.
- **Events (bind and setState)**: To update the interface when the user clicks the button.
- **Styling with StyleSheet**: To define the layout and design.
- **Local Images**: To display the closed and opened cookie images.

## How to Run the Project

1. Make sure you have **Node.js** installed.
2. Install **Expo CLI** (if using Expo):
   ```sh
   npm install -g expo-cli
   ```
3. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/fortune-cookie.git
   ```
4. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```sh
   cd fortune-cookie
   ```
5. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
6. Run the app:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```
   or, if using **React Native CLI**:
   ```sh
   npx react-native run-android
   ```

## How the App Works

1. The app displays an image of a closed fortune cookie.
2. When the **"Break the cookie"** button is pressed, a motivational message is shown, and the opened cookie image appears.
3. Each click generates a new random message.

## What I Learned

This project helped me understand and apply the following **React Native** concepts:

- **Class Components**: How to structure and organize reusable code.
- **State (setState)**: How to store and dynamically update values within the app.
- **Event Handling and State Management**: Using `bind` to link methods and `setState` to update the UI.
- **Styling with StyleSheet**: How to create responsive styles.
- **Handling Local Images**: How to load and switch images dynamically.
